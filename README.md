:axe: Acquaintance with AT&T assembly language, process instructions, system calls

Hello! Here I will tell you about how I spent several hours writing "Hello, world!" in assembly language and what I got to know during this time, namely:

- AT&T vs Intel syntax, the main differences
- Instructions mov, int, call, return
- General purpose registers eax, ebx, ecx, edx
- Translator as, linker ld
- The hexdump utility. Outputs the contents of files in 0x, ASCII, binary representation
- Working with the debugger that many IDEs rely on - GDB (GNU Debugger)

The information presented here is just my understanding of how it actually works. I can be wrong and I will be glad if I am corrected. My contacts:: el.shirak@internet.ru
